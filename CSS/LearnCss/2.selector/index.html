    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
    <article ID = "First">
    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>

    <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
        <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>

    </ul>
