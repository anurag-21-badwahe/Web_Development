    <h1>UNLOCK THE POWER OF BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
    <P1>A blockchain is a way of organising and recording data to maintain a digital distributed ledger, i.e. there
        is no master computer holding the data but participating computers (“nodes”) hold a copy of the data.
        Transactions, agreements and contracts are stored in blocks and each block is linked to the previous one,
        therefore creating a chain. Each block contains a complete and time-stamped record of all transactions
        that occurred in the network. The database can be extended, but previous records cannot be changed. </P1>

    <h2>How Does a Blockchain Work?</h2>
    <p2>The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).
